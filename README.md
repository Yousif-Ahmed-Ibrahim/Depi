# Manufacturing Downtime Dashboard â€“ Power BI

This project was developed as part of the Data Analysis track in the **DEPI Training Program**, and demonstrates the use of Power BI to analyze and monitor manufacturing productivity and downtime.

## Overview

The dashboard provides key performance metrics:

- Total Productivity Time (hours)
- Total Downtime (hours)
- Batches per Operator
- Downtime Causes Breakdown
- Operator-wise Downtime vs. Productivity
- Efficiency Percentage
- Interactive filtering by Date, Operator, and Flavor

## Tools & Technologies

- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

## Objective

The dashboard helps production teams identify downtime patterns, compare operator efficiency, and make data-driven decisions to improve manufacturing performance.

## Usage

1. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop
2. Connect your dataset or use the sample data
3. Use filters and visual tools to analyze performance
4. Optionally publish to Power BI Service for sharing
